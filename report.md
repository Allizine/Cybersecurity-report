<h1>Broadvoice</h1>
<p>A US Company known as Broadvoice who specialized in VoIP (voice over IP), had exposed over 350 million customers' personal information and call transcripts that were being saved for business clients to track analytics among other things. The leak was found by Bob Dianchenko, working with Comparitech to index the Shodan.io IoT search engine, discovered an elasticsearch cluster that contained data collections that store 350 million voicemails without any protection that had been indexed into the search engine. An elasticsearch database is an open-source tool that allowed real-time searching and data analysis. Broadvoice locked down the database on October 2nd, one day after Bob Dianchenko alerted them of the breach. If broadvoice didn't lock down their databases that had been exposed the information would've been used by bad actors for email phishing attacks or held the data as ransom or even identify theft. If broadvoice had locked thier database using any authorazation to conect to the database the whole issue could've been avoided.

<h1>Ukraine Ransomeware</h1>
<p>
A series of cyberattacks in 2017 focusing mostly Ukranian organizations, including banks, minities, and electricity firms. Similar attacks were reported around the globe. The virus used was a modified version of the Peyta ransomeware, using the EternalBlue exploit previously discovered in the older versions of Windows, an exploit developed by the NSA, and was leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group on April 14, 2017. When the virus is ran on the unpatched computer through a program called MeDoc, which was commonly used across all the victims, it would encrypt the Master File Table of the hard drive causing the PC to restart- upon reboot it displays a message to the user demanding $300 in bitcoin. The EternalBlue exploit had been previously identified and patched in March of 2017 to shutdown any exploits for older versions of Windows. The attack was assumed to be aimed at destroying the Ukranian state and not for monitary gain.
